<h2>Introduction</h2>

this tutorial will change something like this:
```
ssh username@remote.device.ip
scp username@remote.device.ip:somefile ./somefile
```

into something like this ðŸ˜Ž:
```
ssh your_alias
scp your_alias:somefile ./somefile
```

<h2>Steps</h2>

open a text editor to ```~/.ssh/config```

write or copy and paste:
```
Host your_alias
  User remote_username
  HostName remote_ip_adress
```
replace ```your_alias``` with whatever you want your alias to be

replace ```remote_username``` with the username of your remote device

replace ```remote_ip_adress``` with the ip address of your remote device, which can be found by using ```ifconfig``` on the remote device

save the file

you can now use ```ssh your_alias```!!
